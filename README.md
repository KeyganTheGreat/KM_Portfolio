# Konstantin's Portfolio
Welcome to my portfolio! I am a dedicated data enthusiast and I will be showcasing my projects here. 
As my portfolio evolves, I look forward to adding diverse projects involving Python, SQL, and other data analysis tools. 


#[SQL](https://github.com/KeyganTheGreat/KM_Portfolio/tree/4efa74cd30c96a04e4b8046886f6e45a3cf057cb/SQL) 


I have had experience in using SQL within my current job, and have used it previously for my PowerBI visualisations. 
These projects were short and meant to test out different SQL functions.

  - Some skills used in this were Joins, CTE's, Windows Functions, Aggregate Functions, Creating Views, Converting Data Types




#[Power BI](https://github.com/KeyganTheGreat/KM_Portfolio/tree/d049f1bbca0e68d3557d97993589fbade16b69d6/PowerBI) 


I have not worked on too many Power BI projects, so these are just my most recent test projects I did in my free time to test out different DAX formulas and Art styles.
